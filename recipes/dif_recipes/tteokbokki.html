    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preparation: Slice fish cakes, chop vegetables, and mince garlic. Soak rice cakes in warm water if they are hard.</li>
        <li>Broth: In a large pan, add 2-3 cups of water or anchovy broth and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Sauce Base: Add gochujang, gochugaru, soy sauce, sugar, and minced garlic to the simmering broth. Stir until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Rice Cakes: Drain the soaked rice cakes and add them to the pan. Stir gently to ensure they don't stick together.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Let the rice cakes cook in the sauce for 7-10 minutes, or until they become soft.</li>
        <li>Fish Cakes and Veggies: Add sliced fish cakes and optional vegetables like cabbage, carrots, and onions. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check Consistency: If the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit more water. If too thin, let it simmer a bit longer.</li>
        <li>Taste Test: Adjust seasoning if necessary. Add more sugar for sweetness or more gochujang for heat.</li>
        <li>Green Onions: Stir in sliced green onions and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Garnish: Optionally, top with hard-boiled eggs and sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Serve: Dish out the Tteok-bokki while hot, preferably on a plate to share.</li>
    </ol>
